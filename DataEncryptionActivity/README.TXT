Intel Corporation - Android Sample Application

This sample app shows step-by-step how to create a JNI library in order to allow execution of compute intensive algorithms to happen in native code instead of at the Dalvik Java layer. Executing the app over a course of five runs on a Medfield tablet with an Intel® Atom™ processor running the Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS, we see a very nice and consistent average of 89% improvement when using the native method.
